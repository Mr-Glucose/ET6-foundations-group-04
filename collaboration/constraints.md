  **January 8th**. Extensions are not an option.
- **Technology Requirements**: We are required to use specific technologies such
  as VS Code, Python, and GitHub.
- **Testing Standards**: All code must pass a minimum of 90% unit test coverage
  and meet quality metrics defined by MIT Emerging Talent Foundations Track instructors.
- **Connectivity**: Some team members might face intermittent internet connectivity.

## Internal: Involuntary

- **Skill Levels**: The team includes members with varying levels of expertise,
  with some being beginners who are still learning the required tools and technologies.
- **Time Availability**: Team members have varying schedules and commitments,
  which can impact how much time each person can contribute.
- **Learning Curve**: Beginners may require additional time to learn new tools,
  frameworks, or workflows, potentially slowing progress.

## Internal: Voluntary

- **Independent Work**: Each team member works independently on their assigned
  tasks but can seek advice or guidance from others as needed.
- **Coding Standards**: The team has agreed to follow a consistent coding style
  guide to maintain quality and readability.
- **Code Reviews**: All pull requests will be reviewed by at least two other
  team members to ensure quality and foster knowledge sharing.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Communication tools like Slack will be used for quick
  questions and advice, while GitHub Discussions and Issues will handle more
  structured feedback.
- **Documentation**: Clear and beginner-friendly comments and documentation are
  mandatory for all code to make it accessible to everyone on the team.
- **Scope Management**: To ensure progress, the project scope is limited to core
  features.
- **Flexibility**: Pioneers United encourages flexibility, allowing members to
  ask for help or advice at any point without hesitation.
