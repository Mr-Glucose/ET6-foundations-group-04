Objective:
Create a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three,
 print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For
 numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

Another way of putting it:

# **FizzBuzz Challenge**

This is a FizzBuzz program that prints numbers from 1 to 100 with specific rules:

- For multiples of three, print "Fizz".
- For multiples of five, print "Buzz".
- For multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

For each number from 1 to 100:
    If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5:
        Print "FizzBuzz"
    Else if the number is divisible by 3:
        Print "Fizz"
    Else if the number is divisible by 5:
        Print "Buzz"
    Else:
        Print the number
