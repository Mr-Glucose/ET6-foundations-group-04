# Challenge: Find the Heaviest Coin

## Description

You have 8 identical coins numbered from 1 to 8. Out of these, only one coin is
heavier than the others. The task is to design an algorithm that finds the
heaviest coin using a balance scale.

### Behavior

- You can use the balance scale to compare the weight of two groups of coins at
 a time.
- The balance scale can indicate whether the two groups of coins are of equal
  weight, or if one group is heavier than the other.
- Your goal is to find the heaviest coin by performing the minimum number of
  weigh-ings. Each weigh-ing can involve two groups of coins being placed on
  opposite sides of the scale.

### Key Points

- The algorithm must use the fewest number of weigh-ings to identify
  the heaviest coin.
- The solution can involve greedy strategies and decision-making based on the
   results of each weigh-ings.

### Minimum Weigh-ings

Determine the minimum number of times you need to use the balance scale to find
the heavier coin.
