# Challenge: Convert Binary Numbers to Decimal

## Description

The "Binary to Decimal" challenge involves converting a binary number (base 2)
into its decimal (base 10) equivalent.

Binary numbers consist of only two digits: 0 and 1,
where each digit represents a power of 2.

Write a function that takes a binary number as a string
and returns its decimal equivalent as an integer.

For example:

- The binary number `1010` equals `10` in decimal.
- The binary number `1111` equals `15` in decimal.

## Example

```python
binary_to_decimal('1010')
# Output: 10 (binary 1010 = decimal 10)

binary_to_decimal('1111')
# Output: 15 (binary 1111 = decimal 15)

binary_to_decimal('1001')
# Output: 9 (binary 1001 = decimal 9)
```
